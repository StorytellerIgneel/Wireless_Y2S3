## 📊 Performance Highlights

| Metric                          | Result                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 📡 **Reduced Network Latency** | ~42% faster than Firebase (local APIs < 100ms avg) |
| 📚 **Self-hosted Gutendex** | Eliminated reliance on public API, enabling <150ms search
| 📁 **Download Size**           | Book download size avg ~4MB |
| 🔌 **Offline Mode**            | Book accessible in <1s after first load |
| 🧠 **AI Chatbot Response**     | <200ms via local WebSocket |
| 🗃️ **Database Footprint**     | <3MB with 1000+ entries; SQLite optimized |

> ⚡ Self-hosted Gutendex and backend APIs reduced external calls by >90%, ensuring high availability, full-text control, and rapid content indexing even under load.

🧠 Unlike apps that depend on live Gutenberg APIs, this project self-hosts Gutendex — a lightweight search backend for Project Gutenberg.
This allows faster, more reliable book browsing and downloading even on unstable or offline networks.
It also provides complete control over search behavior, enabling keyword tuning, metadata filtering, and localized caching.
