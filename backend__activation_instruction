The backend files are all python for now. I used python flask to run them. So, obviously, u need to have flask installed.
The app.py contains routes to all other backend files. This is designed in a way such that when multiple functions are needed, only one file needs to be run.
So, to activate the backend, open a new terminal session. then type

python app.py

u shud see this:
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.43.114:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 139-760-549
this means that the backend is running now. The broadcast address setup is essential to run it on another device ie using expo go

The following session is only needed if you need API services:
Now, navigate into the frontend file that you wish to test/use and find the API_URL constant
you can see that 
//const API_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:5000"; // Change if using a device (use local IP)
const API_URL = "http://192.168.1.8:5000"; //using expogo

the top one is for emulators, and it should be constant
the lower one is for physical devices ie running expo go on ur phone
However, u need to channge the url and ensure that both your pc and ur phone is under the same LAN ie connected to same wifi
If unable, use hotspot of ur phone and pc connect to it
u need to find the ip of ur phone, do so by pressing M after npm start, you can find the device url, it shud be 192.168.x.x, then copy it and paste into the url and then add the :5000
the :5000 is essential as it is the port for service. 
if you see axios: network error then ur api url is wrong, or something set up wrongly

"summaries": [
    "\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen is a classic novel written in the early 19th century. The story delves into themes of love, social class, and individual agency, largely revolving around the life of Elizabeth Bennet, one of five sisters from a modest but genteel family navigating the complex social landscape of Regency England.  The opening of the novel introduces the seemingly universal truth that a single man of wealth is a target for matchmaking mothers in the neighborhood. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her daughters and is excited to hear about the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man who has taken up residence at Netherfield Park. Mr. Bennet's teasing yet indifferent nature contrasts sharply with Mrs. Bennet's anxious and businesslike demeanor as she plans to visit Mr. Bingley to create an opportunity for her daughters. Their witty exchanges set the tone for the story's exploration of family dynamics and social expectations, while also hinting at deeper character developments and the challenges Elizabeth will face regarding love and prejudice in her interactions with Mr. Darcy and the Bingley family.
